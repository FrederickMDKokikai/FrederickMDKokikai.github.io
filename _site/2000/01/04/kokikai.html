<h1 id="kokikai-aikido">Kokikai Aikido</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.kokikai.org">Kokikai Aikido</a> was founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei. Our practice is based on 4 basic principles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Keep One Point to Develop Calmness</li>
    <li>Relax Progressively</li>
    <li>Find Correct Posture in Everything	</li>
    <li>Develop your Positive Mind</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These principles guide our practice and provide a touchstone against which we can evaluate our practice. </p>

<p>Kokikai practice includes empty hand practice, defending against knife (<em>tanto</em>), sword (<em>bokken</em>) and staff (<em>jo</em>), and 
forms (<em>kata</em>) for sword and staff. Other aspects of Kokikai practice include Ki Meditation and Kiatsu (acupressure)</p>
