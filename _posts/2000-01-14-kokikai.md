[Kokikai Aikido](http://www.kokikai.org) was founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei. Our practice is based on 4 basic principles:

> 1. Keep One Point to Develop Calmness
> 2. Relax Progressively
> 3. Find Correct Posture in Everything	
> 4. Develop your Positive Mind

These principles guide our practice and provide a touchstone against which we can evaluate our practice. 

Kokikai practice includes empty hand practice, defending against knife (_tanto_), sword (_bokken_) and staff (_jo_), and 
forms (_kata_) for sword and staff. Other aspects of Kokikai practice include Ki Meditation and Kiatsu (acupressure)
